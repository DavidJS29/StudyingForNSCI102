  { term: "Naval Retrenchment", hint: "Post-Civil War decline", answer: "After the Civil War, the U.S. Navy shrank from 671 ships to only 147 by 1875, ranking 12th in the world behind Britain, France, Russia, Germany and others. Funding focused only on maintenance; ships rotted. Government priorities were Reconstruction, debt, and westward expansion." },
  { term: "Peacetime Naval Mission", hint: "What did the Navy do in peace?", answer: "Protection of maritime trade overseas and 'showing the flag.' SECNAV Gideon Welles: 'In time of peace our naval force should be actively employed in visiting every commercial port where American capital is employed.' Diplomacy and commerce protection were key roles." },
  { term: "Self-Propelled Torpedo", hint: "Invented 1866", answer: "Invented in 1866 by Robert Whitehead (British). A self-propelled underwater weapon that revolutionized naval warfare and forced navies to rethink ship design and tactics." },
  { term: "Sea Mines", hint: "Horned, 1870s", answer: "The horned sea mine (1870s) was developed by Albert Hertz (Prussian). Contact mines that detonate when a ship's hull strikes one of the protruding horns. Changed harbor defense and naval strategy." },
  { term: "Torpedo Boats", hint: "HMS Lightning", answer: "Small, fast surface vessels designed to deliver torpedo attacks. HMS Lightning (1876) was the first purpose-built torpedo boat. Threatened larger warships and led to development of torpedo boat destroyers." },
  { term: "Submarines", hint: "Le Plongeur, 1863", answer: "Le Plongeur (1863) was the first submarine propelled by mechanical (compressed air) power — a French design. Submarines changed naval warfare by allowing underwater attacks on surface ships." },
  { term: "Evolution of Ship Construction", hint: "Steel, armor, engines", answer: "Steel hulls replaced iron; armored decks protected vulnerable areas; breech-loading rifled guns increased accuracy and rate of fire; triple-expansion steam engines enabled 7,500-mile range on 500 tons of coal; transition from coal to oil fuel." },
  { term: "ABCD Ships (1883)", hint: "Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dolphin", answer: "The first four modern U.S. Navy ships, construction began 1883 under SECNAV William Hunt. Named Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Dolphin. Featured double steel hulls, heavy armor, rifled breech-loading guns, and electricity. First 'all-steel' American warships — a boon for the steel industry." },
  { term: "Korean Expedition (1871)", hint: "RADM Rodgers, 5 ships", answer: "Led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers with 5 ships and 650 men (including 100 Marines). Mission: open diplomatic/trade relations with Korea. After being fired upon, Rodgers attacked three Korean forts, killing 243 Koreans. Trade mission ultimately failed." },
  { term: "Cuban Insurrection / Virginius Affair (1873)", hint: "53 executed", answer: "The Virginius was an American ship hired by Cuban insurrectionists to supply their revolution against Spain. It had an American and British crew. Spain captured the ship and executed 53 crew members for piracy, creating enormous international tension. The U.S. nearly declared war. Settlement: Spain paid reparations. The affair sparked a modest naval renaissance." },
  { term: "U.S. Naval Institute", hint: "Founded 1873", answer: "Founded 1873. Published 'Proceedings' — a professional journal featuring articles on current and future naval warfare topics. Replaced unproductive shouting matches with constructive professional discourse. Fostered intellectual development in the Navy." },
  { term: "Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI)", hint: "Founded 1882", answer: "Established 1882. Mission: study foreign navies and remain current on foreign naval strength, strategy, and tactics. Relied on an expanding network of American naval attachés stationed abroad." },
  { term: "Naval War College", hint: "RADM Luce, 1884", answer: "Founded 1884 by RADM Stephen B. Luce. Purpose: 'Apply modern scientific methods to the study and raise naval warfare from the empirical stage to the dignity of a science.' Provided graduate-level study in strategy, tactics, and war plans." },
  { term: "RADM Stephen B. Luce", hint: "Founder of Naval War College", answer: "Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce founded the Naval War College in 1884. Believed naval warfare should be studied scientifically rather than learned only through experience. He brought Alfred Thayer Mahan to teach there, which led to Mahan's groundbreaking work." },
  { term: "RADM Alfred Thayer Mahan", hint: "Sea Power theorist", answer: "Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan was assigned to the Naval War College by Luce. His lectures became 'The Influence of Sea Power upon History' (1890). He argued that naval power was the key to national greatness and his ideas influenced navies worldwide." },
  { term: "The Influence of Sea Power upon History", hint: "Published 1890", answer: "Mahan's landmark 1890 work arguing that naval history teaches permanent strategic lessons; the oceans are a 'great highway' for maritime trade; and a nation achieves power by controlling the sea through its naval fleet. Enormously influential on U.S. and foreign navies." },
  { term: "Sea Control / Command of the Sea", hint: "Mahan's goal", answer: "Mahan's central strategic concept: the goal of sea power is to achieve 'command of the sea' — dominance over naval forces sufficient to control maritime trade routes. This requires defeating the enemy fleet, not just raiding commerce." },
  { term: "Six Conditions of Sea Power", hint: "Mahan's framework", answer: "1. Geographical position, 2. Physical conformation (coastline, harbors), 3. Extent of territory, 4. Population, 5. Character of the people, 6. Character of the government. These conditions determine a nation's potential for sea power." },
  { term: "Views on Commerce Raiding", hint: "Mahan disagreed with it", answer: "Mahan argued that commerce raiding (guerre de course) CANNOT achieve 'command of the sea.' While it can disrupt enemy trade, it cannot defeat the enemy fleet or establish decisive sea control. It is a secondary strategy, not a war-winning one." },
  { term: "Role of Battleships", hint: "Backbone of the fleet", answer: "Mahan argued battleships should be the backbone of any navy. The primary objective should always be the enemy fleet. Battleships concentrated firepower to seek decisive fleet engagements and achieve command of the sea." },
  { term: "Influence of Mahan on World Navies", hint: "TR, Tirpitz, Japan", answer: "Mahan's work influenced Theodore Roosevelt (U.S.), Alfred von Tirpitz (Germany, who built the High Seas Fleet to challenge Britain), and Japan (which aggressively expanded its battleship fleet). His ideas drove the worldwide naval arms race of the late 19th–early 20th centuries." },
